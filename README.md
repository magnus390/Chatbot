Welcome to the Chatbot application where you can ask any questions and the answer will be presented you from the OpenAI API.

**1.  Setting up the repository in the local machine**<br/>
**2.  Creating the API key**<br/>
**3.  Creating the config.js file**<br/>

**1. Setting up the repository in the local machine**

To set up and run the application, please follow the steps below:

Clone the repository by copying the Git URL from GitHub and running the following command in your designated folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:magnus390/Chatbot.git
```

Now open your favorite code editor for coding. In this setup, we will use Visual Studio Code.<br/><br/>

**2. Creating the API key**

Create your account on openai.com website, after that create your API key using the below link:-

https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Also, save the key somewhere else as after creating, it won't be visible to you.<br/><br/>

**3. Creating the config file**

Create the config.js file in the same folder as other JS, HTML, and CSS files and write the below code inside it:-

```
const key = '<YOUR_API_KEY>';

export default key;
```

Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual key and don't forget to write the config file in the .gitignore file so that your credentials will be protected.<br/><br/>

**4.  Running the application**

After completing all the above steps run the application by right click index.html file and selecting "Open with Live server", below are some output screenshots.
